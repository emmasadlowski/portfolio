        <h2 section id="companies">Companies I've Worked With</h2>
        <p>While working with The Bulleit Group, I had the pleasure of working with some incredibly fascinating
            technology startups. My involvement in these projects ranged from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drafting and editing unique public-facing content, including press releases, blog posts,
                bylines,
                bios, social media posts, and marketing materials.
            </li>
            <li>Performing in-depth messaging audits to gauge a client's competitive industry position. We used
                this
                data to
                outline strategic recommendations for upward mobility.
            </li>
            <li>Engaging with SMEs to understand products and help us inform internal and external
                documentation.
            </li>
            <li>Creating training decks for clients and team members.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, a large part of my role involved collaborating with my wonderful team members at Bulleit.
            As
            someone with a collaborative spirit, I will always contribute to the success of every project that
            comes
            my way.</p>

            <p>The following are a few kind testimonials from my work colleagues throughout the years. If you would
                like any professional
                references, I would be happy to connect you.</p>
            <blockquote>"As a writer, Emma displays a strong talent for thinking creatively and a willingness to try
                new
                approaches to addressing challenging client requests. She has been a true value to our team, working
                cross-functionally with stakeholders and team members to
                unlock project success."</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Emma is always ready to step in at any phase of the content development process. She
                develops
                high quality
                written pieces that our account and client teams consistently compliment. She takes pride in
                her work and
                intrinsically
                strives to implement all the feedback she receives to not only produce high-quality deliverables,
                but to
                continue
                improving her own writing skills."</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Emma always keeps team
                members in the loop by proactively sharing daily action lists and the statuses of all ongoing
                projects.
                She
                takes initiative
                by suggesting next steps and offering to handle tasks that fit into her schedule â€” proving her
                strong
                time management skills and ability
                to complete her work while operating autonomously."</blockquote>
