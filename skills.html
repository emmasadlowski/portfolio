        <p>While working with The Bulleit Group, I had the pleasure of working with some fascinating
            technology startups. My involvement in these projects ranged from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drafting and editing unique public-facing content, including press releases, blog posts,
                bylines,
                bios, social media posts, and marketing materials.
            </li>
            <li>Performing in-depth messaging audits to gauge a client's competitive industry position. We used
                this
                data to
                outline strategic recommendations for upward brand image mobility.
            </li>
            <li>Interviewing SMEs to understand products and inform internal and external
                documentation.
            </li>
            <li>Creating and presenting training and audit decks for clients.
            </li>
        </ul>

                new

                develops
                high quality
                written pieces that our account and client teams consistently compliment. She takes pride in
                her work and
                intrinsically
                strives to implement all the feedback she receives to not only produce high-quality deliverables,
                but to
                continue
                improving her own writing skills."</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Emma always keeps team

                takes initiative
                by suggesting next steps and offering to handle tasks that fit into her schedule â€” proving her
                strong
                time management skills and ability
                to complete her work while operating autonomously."</blockquote>
