                <a href="samples/Technical Writing sample.pdf" target="_blank">Technical Writing Sample</a>
                <p> - This is an unpublished momentum byline that I drafted for a software company. The client requested
                    that I
                    create a
                    draft based on a webinar they had recently hosted about alternatives to Apache Kafka. I used the
                    contents from the webinar and did
                    extensive
                    research on distributed environments to draft an informative, cohesive article that complemented the
                    webinar.</p>
                <a href="samples/AMR Writing Sample.pdf" target="_blank">AMR Writing Sample</a>
                <p> - This is a blog post that I
                    drafted for an autonomous robotics floor-cleaning company. I interviewed the
                    security director and another SME about ongoing data security challenges in robotics, using our
                    conversation
                    and the affiliated white paper as the core of the blog post.</p>
                <a href="samples/Zoox CLAMS.pdf" target="_blank">Zoox Writing Sample</a>
                <p> - This document outlines how Zoox's "CLAMS" self-driving stack
                    operates. This document stems from a larger
                    project
                    that involved building out Zoox's self-driving terminology backlog as the company was preparing
                    for
                    launch. My colleague and I interviewed 15+ engineers at Zoox to draft and verify these documents,
                    which
                    were used to inform future marketing collateral. With each document we created, we were careful to
                    point
                    out key
                    terms and areas that needed verification or more info.</p>
