        <br>
        <p class="important-quote">Throughout my life, I have always been fascinated by technology, as well as
            how to make complex topics more accessible and easily understandable.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>It
            all started when I was 11 years old, and like many kids my age, I was obsessed with the online
            virtual pet
            world called neopets.com. At one point, I came across an HTML tutorial on the website that taught users how
            to customize their own webpages! Who knew you could do that? I was enthralled by the
            idea of customizing my Neopet's own webpage using their online (albeit clunky) lessons and resources. I
            spent hours
            tinkering with the
            front-end interface and learning how to type — all while becoming more familiar with how computers worked.
            At
            the
            same time, I
            had so many questions about
            how it all <i>actually</i> worked. I wanted to know more.
            <br><br>
            Many years later,
            I took up a job as a science and tech journalist for my university's student newspaper, where I wrote weekly
            stories about science and tech in the UC Davis community. I had the pleasure of
            interviewing some of the brightest professors, scientists, and healthcare professionals at UC Davis — taking
            their thoughts and ideas and transforming them into stories for the UC Davis student body. It was an
            experience that I'm forever grateful for, and one that set the foundation for my professional career.
            <br><br>
            I took my love for learning into the classroom after graduating UC Davis in 2018. As an elementary assistant
            teacher, I
            specialized in teaching language arts classes and providing one-on-one writing assistance.
            <br><br>
            Soon after, I pivoted back into science and technology writing to take on a Content Strategist role with The
            Bulleit Group, an award-winning public relations agency. While there, I worked with our account teams to
            transform
            our
            clients’ business goals into strategic, memorable, and error-free content output. My role
            involved drafting
            press
            releases, blog posts, internal messaging docs, social media posts, presentation decks, newsletters, internal
            documentation, and more — all within a fast-paced, deadline-driven working environment. I have also worked
            on long-term
            content projects, such as competitive audits
            and entire brand overhauls, which have helped our clients to adopt more optimal content strategies. My
            editorial contributions
            to The Bulleit Group have helped our clients win awards and become strategic, competitive forces in their
            respective industries.

        <p class="important-quote">
            Now, I'm ready for my next challenge and diving deeper into the technical realm. I'm currently pursuing a
            career in
            technical writing, information architecture, API documentation, and/or content strategy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>At my core, I am a curious, organized, and reliable team player. With every project I take on, I ensure that
            our team has all the resources we need to successfully take the project through its lifecycle and meet our
            goals. While I no longer dabble in creating silly webpages for my virtual pets, my curiousity has only grown
            as I dive deeper into the technical space. I am
            motivated to help others understand complex topics and make learning experiences enjoyable (and accessible)
            for any audience. Aside from my writing and project management skills, I am also proficient in HTML/CSS,
            Git, and DITA XML.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not writing, I love hiking in the North San Diego County area, working on creative projects,
            and
            trying out new coffee shops. Right now I'm learning JavaScript and Adobe InDesign!
