        <br>
        <p class="important-quote">Throughout my life, I have always been fascinated by technology and the process of
            making complex topics more accessible and easily understandable.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Like many kids in the
            mid-2000s, I suppose you could say I was obsessed
            with
            the online
            virtual pet
            world that was neopets.com. At one point, I came across an HTML tutorial on the website that taught users
            how
            to customize their own Neopet webpages (who knew you could do that?). Excited by my discovery, I spent hours
            tinkering with the
            front-end interface, determined to figure out how to display the HTML/CSS styles I liked and show off my
            creative flair. I felt empowered
            as
            a kid to have easy-to-follow user guides and tutorials that taught me how to develop webpages.
            <br><br>
            At
            the
            same time, I
            had so many questions about
            how it all <i>actually</i> worked behind the scenes.
            <br><br>
            That curiosity followed me into high school and university. Years later,
            I took up a job as a science and tech journalist for my university's student newspaper, where I wrote weekly
            stories about science and tech in the UC Davis community. I
            interviewed some of the brightest professors, scientists, and healthcare professionals at UC Davis, and
            transformed their thoughts and ideas into unique stories for our readers. It was an
            experience that I'm forever grateful for, and one that set the foundation for my professional career.
            <br><br>
            After a year of teaching, I pivoted back into science and tech writing in 2019 to take on a Content
            Strategist role with The
            Bulleit Group, an award-winning public relations agency. While there, I worked with our account teams to
            transform
            our
            clients’ business goals into strategic and memorable content output. My role
            involved drafting and editing
            press
            releases, blog posts, internal messaging docs, social media posts, presentation decks, newsletters, internal
            documentation, and more. I also worked
            on long-term content projects with my team, such as competitive audits
            and full-scale brand overhauls, to outline strategic recommendations for optimal content strategies.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="important-quote">
            Now, I'm ready for my next challenge and am diving deeper into the technical realm. I'm currently pursuing a
            career in
            technical writing, information architecture, API documentation, and/or content strategy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>At my core, I am a curious, organized, and reliable team player. With every project I take on, I ensure that
            my team has all the resources we need to successfully take the project through its lifecycle and meet our
            goals. While I no longer dabble in creating silly webpages for my virtual pets, my curiosity has only grown
            as I dive deeper into my technical communications practice. I want to continue learning in my work and in my
            professional development. I am
            motivated to help others understand complex topics and make learning experiences enjoyable (and accessible)
            for any audience. Aside from my writing and project management skills, I am also proficient in HTML/CSS,
            Git, and DITA XML.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not writing, I love hiking in the North San Diego County area, working on creative projects. Here's
            a glimpse at some of my creations!
