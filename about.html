        <h1>About Emma</h1>
        <img src="images/PictureofMe2.jpg" class="picture-of-me">
        <br>
        <p class="important-quote">Throughout my life, I have always been fascinated by technology and the process of
            making complex topics more accessible and easily understandable.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>I've always had a deep love for learning that translates in my day-to-day work and creative passions. I enjoy
            the challenge of
            quickly
            becoming familiar with a new subject, and using what I know to craft compelling stories and content.</p>
        <p>While studying Human Development and Sociology at UC Davis,
            I worked as a science and tech journalist for my university's student newspaper,
            where I wrote weekly
            stories about science and tech in the community. I
            interviewed some of the brightest professors, scientists, and healthcare professionals at UC Davis, and
            transformed their thoughts and ideas into unique stories for our readers.
            <br><br>
            I taught in an elementary school after graduatiion, but pivoted back into science and tech writing in 2019
            to take
            on a Content
            Strategist role with The
            Bulleit Group, an award-winning public relations agency. While there, I worked with our account teams to
            transform
            our
            clients’ business goals into strategic and memorable content output. My role
            involved drafting and editing
            press
            releases, blog posts, internal messaging docs, social media posts, presentation decks, newsletters, internal
            documentation, and more. I also worked
            on long-term content projects with my team, such as competitive audits
            and full-scale brand overhauls, to outline strategic recommendations for optimal content strategies.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="important-quote">
            Now, I'm ready for my next challenge and am diving deeper into the technical realm. I'm currently pursuing a
            career in
            technical writing, information architecture, API documentation, and/or content strategy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>At my core, I am a curious, organized, and reliable team player. With every project I take on, I ensure that
            my team has all the resources we need to successfully take the project through its lifecycle and meet our
            goals. My curiosity has only grown
            as I dive deeper into my technical communications practice — I would love more than anything to continue
            learning in my work and in my
            professional development. I am
            motivated to help others understand complex topics and make learning experiences enjoyable (and accessible)
            for any audience. Aside from my writing and project management skills, I am also proficient in HTML/CSS,
            Git, and DITA XML.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not writing, I love hiking in the North San Diego County area, working on creative projects. Here's
            a glimpse at some of my creations!
