        <h1>About Emma</h1>
        <img src="images/PictureofMe2.jpg" class="picture-of-me">
        <p class="about-intro">Throughout collegiate and my professional
            career, I have always been drawn to
            storytelling and figuring out
            how to make complex topics more accessible and easily understandable.</p>

        <h2>How it started</h2>
        <p>When I look back on where my interest in science and technology began, I can't help but laugh. It
            all started when I was 11 years old, and like many kids my age, I was absolutely obsessed with the online
            virtual
            world called neopets.com (remember that one?). At one point, I came across an HTML tutorial on the website.
            It was
            an acutal step-by-step tutorial that taught kids how to make their own webpages! I was enthralled by the
            idea of customizing my Neopet's own webpage using their online (albeit clunky) resources. I spent hours
            tinkering with the
            interface, learning how to type and becoming more familiar with how computers worked. At the same time, I
            had so many questions about
            how it all <i>actually</i> worked.
            <br><br>
            Many, many years later,
            I signed up to be a science and tech journalist for my university's student newspaper. Week by week, I wrote
            about stories that spotlighted news around science and technology in my community. I had the pleasure of
            interviewing some of the brightest professors, scientists, and healthcare professionals at UC Davis — taking
            their thoughts and ideas and transforming them into stories for the UC Davis student body. It was an
            experience that I'm forever grateful for, and one that set the foundation for my professional career.
            <br><br>
            I took my love for learning into the classroom following graduation. As an elementary assistant teacher, I
            specialized in teaching language arts classes and providing one-on-one writing assistance.
            <br><br>
            Soon after, I pivoted back into science and technology writing to take on a Content Strategist role with The
            Bulleit Group, an award-winning public relations agency. There, I worked with our account teams to transform
            our
            clients’ business goals and acumen into strategic, compelling, and memorable content output. My role
            involved drafting
            press
            releases, blog posts, internal messaging docs, social media posts, presentation decks, newsletters, internal
            documentation, and more — all within a fast-paced, deadline-driven working environment. I have also worked
            on long-term
            content projects, such as competitive audits
            and entire brand overhauls, which have helped our clients to adopt more optimal content strategies. My
            editorial contributions
            to The Bulleit Group have helped our clients win awards and become strategic, competitive forces in their
            respective industries.

        <h2>How it's going</h2>
        <p class="important-quote">
            Now, I'm ready for my next challenge and diving deeper into the technical realm. I'm currently pursuing a
            career in
            technical writing, information architecture, API documentation, and/or UX writing.
        </p>
        <p>I am a curious, organized, and creative person by nature. Though the structure of my work is often
            fast-paced and project-oriented, I’ve always had a sharp eye for
            detail. With every project I take on, I’m careful to ensure that our team has all the resources we need to
            successfully take the project to completion and meet the client’s business goals.
            <br><br>
            To me, every day offers an opportunity to learn something new. And as a former educator, I have always been
            motivated to help others understand complex topics and make learning experiences enjoyable (and accessible)
            for any audience. Even
            after receiving my degrees in Human Development and Sociology at UC Davis, I continue to pursue
            opportunities that will further my learning and cotribute to the world around me. I am proficient in
            HTML/CSS, Git, and DITA XML, and I'm excited
            to continue to learn and help others through my skills. I look forward to demonstrating ways to craft
            high-quality documentation for users!
            <br><br>
            When I'm not writing, I love hiking in the North San Diego County area, working on creative projects,
            and
            trying out new coffee shops. Right now I'm learning JavaScript and Adobe InDesign!
