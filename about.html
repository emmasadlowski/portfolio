        <p class="important-quote">Throughout my life, I have always been fascinated by technology, as well as
            how to make complex topics more accessible and easily understandable.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>It all goes back to when I was 11 years old. Like many kids at that age in the mid-2000s, I was obsessed with
            the online
            virtual pet
            world, neopets.com. At one point, I came across an HTML tutorial on the website that taught users how
            to customize their own Neopet webpages. Who knew you could do that? I must've
            spent too many hours
            tinkering with the
            front-end interface, determined to figure out how to deploy the HTML/CSS styles I liked.
            At
            the
            same time, I
            had so many questions about
            how it all <i>actually</i> worked behind the scenes.
            <br><br>
            My curiousity followed me into high school and university. Many years later,
            I took up a job as a science and tech journalist for my university's student newspaper, where I wrote weekly
            stories about science and tech in the UC Davis community. I
            interviewed some of the brightest professors, scientists, and healthcare professionals at UC Davis, and
            transformed their thoughts and ideas into thoughtful stories for the UC Davis student body. It was an
            experience that I'm forever grateful for, and one that set the foundation for my professional career.
            <br><br>
            I took my love for learning into the classroom after graduating UC Davis in 2018. As an elementary assistant
            teacher, I
            specialized in teaching language arts classes and providing one-on-one writing assistance.
            <br><br>
            Soon after, I pivoted back into science and technology writing to take on a Content Strategist role with The
            Bulleit Group, an award-winning public relations agency. While there, I worked with our account teams to
            transform
            our
            clients’ business goals into strategic, memorable, and error-free content. My role
            involved drafting
            press
            releases, blog posts, internal messaging docs, social media posts, presentation decks, newsletters, internal
            documentation, and more. I also worked
            on long-term
            content projects, such as competitive audits
            and entire brand overhauls, which have helped our clients to adopt more optimal content strategies. My
            editorial contributions
            to The Bulleit Group have helped our clients win awards and become strategic, competitive forces in their
            respective industries.

        <p class="important-quote">
            Now, I'm ready for my next challenge and diving deeper into the technical realm. I'm currently pursuing a
            career in
            technical writing, information architecture, API documentation, and/or content strategy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>At my core, I am a curious, organized, and reliable team player. With every project I take on, I ensure that
            my team has all the resources we need to successfully take the project through its lifecycle and meet our
            goals. While I no longer dabble in creating silly webpages for my virtual pets, my curiousity has only grown
            as I dive deeper into the technical space. I am
            motivated to help others understand complex topics and make learning experiences enjoyable (and accessible)
            for any audience. Aside from my writing and project management skills, I am also proficient in HTML/CSS,
            Git, and DITA XML.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not writing, I love hiking in the North San Diego County area, working on creative projects,
            and
            trying out new coffee shops.
